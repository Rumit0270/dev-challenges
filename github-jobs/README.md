# Github Jobs Challenge

The code is for the challenge on Github Jobs. I used Github jobs API (https://jobs.github.com) for accessing jobs data. I used cors anywhere (https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/) to bypass browser CORS policy. A working page is deployed on: https://steady-fiction.surge.sh/
