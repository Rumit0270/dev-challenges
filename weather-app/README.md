# Weather App Challenge

The code is for the challenge on Weather app. I used the third party API at https://www.metaweather.com/api for accessing weather and location data. I used cors anywhere (https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/) to bypass browser CORS policy. A working page is deployed on: https://undesirable-icicle.surge.sh/
